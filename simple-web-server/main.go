	// A database is no File Server, as databases only deal with structured data accessed by a query.
	// Indicate the directory with files to be served
	// - NAS (Network attached storage) is dedicated file server hardware
	// - DMS (Document Management System) is a file server dedicated to storing documents (Word, PDF, but not blob data or videos)
	// If present, http.FileServer serves index.html by default, otherwise it shows the directory.
	// The FileServer is used to serve Front End files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) instead of plain text when handling (dynamic) requests.

	// With the gorilla mux package, to acces a file or directory provide the full path from the current working directory, regardless of the path requested
